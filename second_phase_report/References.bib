abstract = {The achievement of a solar powered aircraft capable of continuous flight was still a dream some years ago, but this great challenge has become feasible today. In fact, significant progresses have been realized recently in the domains of flexible solar cells, high energy density batteries, miniaturized MEMS and CMOS sensors, and powerful processors. The concept is quite simple; equipped with solar cells covering its wing, it retrieves energy from the sun in order to supply power to the propulsion system and the control electronics, and charge the battery with the surplus of energy. During the night, the only energy available comes from the battery, which discharges slowly until the next morning when a new cycle starts. Nevertheless, major interdisciplinary effort is necessary to optimize and integrate concepts and technologies to a fully functional system. As a matter of fact, the major issue is the combination and sizing of the different parts in order to maximize a certain criterion, for example the endurance, one parameter being the embedded payload. In 2004, the Autonomous Systems Lab of EPFL/ETHZ launched the Sky-Sailor project under a contract with the European Space Agency. The objectives are the study and realization of a solar aircraft fully autonomous in navigation and power generation flying on Earth and thus validate the feasibility of a Mars dedicated version. This lecture presents the methodology used for the global design of solar powered airplanes that are intended to achieve continuous flight on Earth. It was applied to the first prototype of Sky-Sailor but it is rather general so that it can be used as much for small airplane weighing some hundreds of gram as for solar high altitude long endurance (HALE) platforms with a wingspan of several tens of meters.},

abstract = {Ascent trajectory optimization with thermal effects is addressed for a stratospheric airship. Basic thermal characteristics of the stratospheric airship are introduced. Besides, the airship's equations of motion are constructed by including the factors about aerodynamic force, added mass and wind profiles which are developed based on horizontal-wind model. For both minimum-time and minimum-energy flights during ascent, the trajectory optimization problem is described with the path and terminal constraints in different scenarios and then, is converted into a parameter optimization problem by a direct collocation method. Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer(SNOPT) is employed as a nonlinear programming solver and two scenarios are adopted. The solutions obtained illustrate that the trajectories are greatly affected by the thermal behaviors which prolong the daytime minimum-time flights of about 20.8{\%} compared with that of nighttime in scenario 1 and of about 10.5{\%} in scenario 2. And there is the same trend for minimum-energy flights. For the energy consumption of minimum-time flights, 6{\%} decrease is abstained in scenario 1 and 5{\%} decrease in scenario 2. However, a few energy consumption reduction is achieved for minimum-energy flights. Solar radiation is the principal component and the natural wind also affects the thermal behaviors of stratospheric airship during ascent. The relationship between take-off time and performance of airship during ascent is discussed. it is found that the take-off time at dusk is best choice for stratospheric airship. And in addition, for saving energy, airship prefers to fly downwind. {\textcopyright} 2013 COSPAR. The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Accurate calculation of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere$\backslash$nhas always been a matter of importance for meteorologists. Potential$\backslash$nwater vapor (POWV) or maximum precipitable water vapor can be an$\backslash$nappropriate base for estimation of probable maximum precipitation (PMP)$\backslash$nin an area, leading to probable maximum flood (PMF) and flash flood$\backslash$nmanagement systems. PWV and POWV have miscellaneously been estimated by$\backslash$nmeans of either discrete solutions such as tables, diagrams or empirical$\backslash$nmethods; however, there is no analytical formula for POWV even in a$\backslash$nparticular atmospherical condition. In this article, fundamental$\backslash$ngoverning equations required for analytical calculation of POWV are$\backslash$nfirst introduced. Then, it will be shown that this POWV calculation$\backslash$nrelies on a Riemann integral solution over a range of altitude whose$\backslash$nintegrand is merely a function of altitude. The solution of the integral$\backslash$ngives rise to a series function which is bypassed by approximation of$\backslash$nsaturation vapor pressure in the range of -55 to 55 degrees Celsius, and$\backslash$nan analytical formula for POWV in an atmosphere of constant lapse rate$\backslash$nis proposed. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the suggested$\backslash$nequation, exact calculations of saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR) at$\backslash$ndifferent surface temperatures were performed. The formula was compared$\backslash$nwith both the diagrams from the US Weather Bureau and SALR. The results$\backslash$ndemonstrated unquestionable capability of analytical solutions and also$\backslash$nequivalent functions.},

abstract = {The solar array layout is one of the critical factors affecting the output performance of a solar array on a stratospheric airship. Optimizing the layout to improve output energy per day is very important for a long endurance vehicle, but the research about this subject is rare. This paper outlines a numerical method based on a rotating model of a stratospheric airship to optimize the solar array layout. Combined with the solar radiation model, the solar array layout optimization model applying genetic algorithm is developed using a MATLAB computer program in this paper. Compared with the design parameters of three stratospheric solar-powered airships, the theoretical model is proved to be feasible. In the course of the study, the effects of the starting point and the central angle of solar array are discussed in detail. In addition, the optimal results of the solar array layout for four common situations are investigated using the method. The results indicate that this method is helpful in the preparation stage for installing large area flexible solar arrays.},

@article{Hwang2014,
abstract = {The design of satellites and their operation is a complex task that involves a large number of variables and multiple engineering disciplines. Thus, it could benefit from the application of multidisciplinary design optimization, but previous efforts have been hindered by the complexity of the modeling and implementation, discontinuities in the design space, and the wide range of time scales.Weaddress these issues by applying a new mathematical framework for gradient-based multidisciplinary optimization that automatically computes the coupled derivatives of the multidisciplinary system via a generalized form of the adjoint method. The modeled disciplines are orbit dynamics, attitude dynamics, cell illumination, temperature, solar power, energy storage, and communication. Many of these disciplines include functions with discontinuities and nonsmooth regions that are addressed to enable a numerically exact computation of the derivatives for all of the modeled variables. The wide-ranging time scales in the design problem, spanning 30 s to one year, are captured through a combination of multipoint optimization and the use of a small time step in the analyses. Optimizations involving over 25,000 design variables and 2.2 million state variables require 100 h to converge three and five orders of magnitude in optimality and feasibility, respectively. The results show that the geometric design variables yield a 40{\%} improvement in the total data downloaded, which is the objective function, and the operational design variables yield another40{\%}improvement. This demonstrates not only the value in this approach for the design of satellites and their operation, but also promise for its application to the design of other large-scale engineering systems.},

abstract = {A key technical challenge for high-altitude, or near-space concepts is autonomous station keeping, or the ability to remain fixed over a geolocation in the presence of winds. Although at 65,000 ft altitude and above, one is above weather (i.e., storms, rain), winds still exist. And to station keep in the presence of these winds requires propulsive power. This paper focuses on the analysis of the station-keeping performance of a notional solar-powered airship operating at an altitude around 65,000. The vehicle has a lifting-gas volume of 6.1 x 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} ft³, and is solar electric powered with the entire upper surface covered by solar cells. Electric motors and propellers provide propulsion, additional on-board power is required for the payload and auxiliary equipment, and batteries are used for power storage. In this paper, the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle is estimated, the wind environment is characterized, and the solar power available is determined for several geolocations and time of year. This power available is then compared to the power required for station keeping in the presence of winds. It is shown that due to diurnal solar variations and season winds a large airship may be unable to meet station-keeping performance requirements in certain months of the year due to power limitations.

abstract = {Full three-dimensional optimal-ascent trajectory design is addressed for a stratospheric airship platform, considering real jet stream and flight constraints. The target airship's equations of motion are first constructed by including wind effects and its inherent features such as added mass and buoyancy effects. For realistic trajectory optimization, additional necessary modeling of the jet stream, aerodynamic force, and thrust are established based on a flight test, wind-tunnel test, and meteorological observation data. In addition, detailed path constraints such as the target airship's performance and local airspace are also accounted for. The sequential quadratic programming approach is employed as a numerical solver for both minimum flight time and minimum-energy performance indices. The solutions obtained satisfy all of the constraints and are largely affected by the jet stream of high wind speed. From the optimization results, the minimum flight time trajectory is recommended due to the low flight performance of the airship in contrast to its huge size and heavy weight.

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {A key technical challenge for high-altitude, or near-space, concepts is autonomous stationkeeping: the ability to remain fixed over a geolocation in the presence of winds. Although operational altitudes of 65,000 ft and above are above weather (i.e., storms, rain), winds are still present To stationkeep in the presence of these winds requires propulsive power, and these vehicles tend to be quite power-limited. This paper focuses on the analysis of the stationkeeping performance of a large notional airship operating at an altitude of 65,000 ft, with a focus on the maneuvering power required. The vehicle has a lifting-gas volume of 6.1 × 10$\backslash$n                        6 ft$\backslash$n                        3 and is solar electric powered, with the entire upper surface covered by solar cells. Electric motors and propellers provide propulsion, and batteries are used for power storage. In this paper, the vehicle's surge and directional dynamics are characterized, the wind environment is modeled, and simple control and guidance algorithms are developed and evaluated. In particular, the maneuvering power required is statistically determined, using a covariance analysis. It is shown that the vehicle is dynamically stable and sluggish, and that significant thrust and control power may be required to stationkeep in turbulence. This additional maneuvering power required may be a significant design driver.},

Such an analysis is an important ingredient in the assessment of the safety and reliability of structures. A major challenge in engineering applications lies in the fact that high computational costs have to be faced. Methods have to be developed that admit assertions about the sensitivity of the output with as few computations as possible. This article serves to explore various techniques from precise and imprecise probability theory that may contribute to achieving this goal. It is a case study using an aerospace engineering example and compares sensitivity analysis methods based on random sets, fuzzy sets, interval spreads simulated with the aid of the Cauchy distribution, and sensitivity indices calculated by direct Monte Carlo simulation. Computational cost, accuracy, interpretability, ability to incorporate correlated input and applicability to large scale problems will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Surrogate assisted global optimization is gaining popularity. Similarly, modern advances in computing power increasingly rely on parallelization rather than faster processors. This paper examines some of the methods used to take advantage of parallelization in surrogate based global optimization. A key issue focused on in this review is how different algorithms balance exploration and exploitation. Most of the papers surveyed are adaptive samplers that employ Gaussian Process or Kriging surrogates. These allow sophisticated approaches for balancing exploration and exploitation and even allow to develop algorithms with calculable rate of convergence as function of the number of parallel processors. In addition to optimization based on adaptive sampling, surrogate assisted parallel evolutionary algorithms are also surveyed. Beyond a review of the present state of the art, the paper also argues that methods that provide easy parallelization, like multiple parallel runs, or methods that rely on population of designs for diversity deserve more attention.},

abstract = {This paper presents an adjoint method for sensitivity analysis that is used in an aero-structural aircraft design framework. The aero-structural analysis uses high-fidelity models of both the aerodynamics and the structures. Aero-structural sensitivities are computed using a coupled-adjoint approach that is based on previously developed single discipline sensitivity analysis. Alternative strategies for coupled sensitivity analysis are also discussed. The aircraft geometry and a structure of fixed topology are parameterized using a large number of design variables. The aero-structural sensitivities of aerodynamic and structural functions with respect to these design variables are computed and compared with results given by the complex-step derivative approximation. The coupled-adjoint procedure is shown to yield very accurate sensitivities and to be computationally efficient, making high-fidelity aero-structural design feasible for problems with thousands of design variables.},

abstract = {The resurgence of airships has created a need for dynamics models and simulation capabilities adapted to these lighter-than-air vehicles. However, the modeling techniques for airship dynamics have lagged behind and are less systematic than those for fixed-wing aircraft. A state-of-the-art literature review is presented on airship dynamics modeling, aiming to provide a comprehensive description of the main problems in this area and a useful source of references for researchers and engineers interested in modern airship applications. The references are categorized according to the major topics in this area: aerodynamics, flight dynamics, incorporation of structural flexibility, incorporation of atmospheric turbulence, and effects of ballonets. Relevant analytical, numerical, and semi-empirical techniques are discussed, with a particular focus on how the main differences between lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air aircraft have been addressed in the modeling. Directions are suggested for future research on each of these topics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose ? The purpose of this current study is to identify the optimal stable position of airship, with reference to spatial variation of atmospheric wind flow, so as to reduce the vibrations and thus aid in the development of control mechanism of airship dynamics. Design/methodology/approach ? Study of uniform flow under steady?state conditions was carried out through the measurements of pressure and velocity in a wind tunnel at low Mach numbers on airship model (in order of size, 1:13) inclined to the uniform air stream at various angles. The measurements have been made for a range of angles of incidence, in both vertical and horizontal planes, with a Reynolds number, based on the free stream velocity and a body cross?sectional dimension, of order of four and six, respectively. Steady?state numerical simulations were performed, serving comparative investigation with experimental data for the specific case of the model inclined to the free stream, with orientation of side?slip (yaw) angle ?=0 and angle of attack (pitch) ?=0. Findings ? The numerical results showed similar trend as found by experimental analysis. In this study, several factors such as the pressure (Cp), lift (CL), drag (CD) coefficients, pressure and air velocity were taken into account for comparative analysis. The analysis paved the way in identification of constructively stable position of airship model with orientation of ?=0 and ?=0, with respect to air flow direction. Practical implications ? The current findings aid in the development of control mechanism of airship dynamics. Originality/value ? The experimental analysis of the airship model is presented along with computational fluid dynamics analysis of optimised shape of airship model in different orientations with respect to direction of airflow. ? 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}For multiobjective optimization problems, different optimization variables have different influences on objectives, which implies that attention should be paid to the variables according to their sensitivity. However, previous optimization studies have not considered the variables sensitivity or conducted sensitivity analysis independent of optimization. In this paper, an integrated algorithm is proposed, which combines the optimization method SPEA (Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm) with the sensitivity analysis method SRCC (Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient). In the proposed algorithm, the optimization variables are worked as samples of sensitivity analysis, and the consequent sensitivity result is used to guide the optimization process by changing the evolutionary parameters. Three cases including a mathematical problem, an airship envelope optimization, and a truss topology optimization are used to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the integrated algorithm. The results showed that this algorithm is able to simultaneously achieve parameter sensitivity and a well-distributed Pareto optimal set, without increasing the computational time greatly in comparison with the SPEA method.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The aeroelastic behavior of a large airship at various flight conditions is considered. The study is focused on static aeroelastic problems, such as efficiency (reversal) of control, shift of aerodynamic center, change of other aerodynamic derivatives, and on dynamic problems such as flutter, gust response. The theoretical investigations use ABAQUS and MSC/NASTRAN finite element programs and updated ARGON multidisciplinary software package based on the polynomial Ritz method. A simplified airship mathematical model for ARGON calculations (and also for the conceptual design of a multifunctional modular wind tunnel model) is estimated using MSC/NASTRAN static nonlinear analysis and modal analysis. Stiffness parameters of the physical model are identified using an optimisation procedure. Main principles of the scheduled experimental investigations of dynamically/ elastically scaled and “rigid” aerodynamic models and their conceptual descriptions are presented. 1.},

abstract = {This work is devoted to the numerical calculation of heat and fluid flow past spherical particles and non-spherical particles of various shapes. Although numerous works have investigated drag forces (cd) for spherical and non-spherical particles, works about the Nusselt number (Nu) relations for non-spherical particles are rare. Motivated by this fact, as a first step we consider cuboid, spherical and ellipsoidal particles in steady-state regimes corresponding to Reynolds numbers (Re) from 10 up to 250. Due to the asymmetric flow existing when Re approaches the value of 250, all simulations are made using a three-dimensional domain. Good agreement was observed when our numerical results gained for the sphere were compared with published values for drag coefficients and Nusselt numbers. Based on the analysis of numerical results obtained for non-spherical particles we found out that in addition to the Reynolds number three geometry parameters influence particle-fluid interaction: the drag coefficient depends primarily on the normalized longitudinal length, while both the sphericity and the crosswise sphericity influence the Nusselt number. For that reason new correlations are developed for both the drag coefficient and the Nusselt number. The accuracy of the closures developed for cd and Nu is discussed in a comparison with published models. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Palacios2014,
abstract = {The accurate evaluation of aircraft fuel burn over a complete mission is computationally expensive and may require millions of aerodynamic performance evaluations. Thus, it is advantageous to use surrogate models as approximations of high-fidelity aerodynamic or aerostructural models. Conventional surrogate models, such as the radial basis function and kriging, cannot model these functions accurately, especially in the transonic regime. To address this issue, we explore several ways to improve the accuracy of surrogate models. First, we employ an adaptive sampling algorithm to complement a traditional space-filling algorithm. Second, we improve the kriging surrogate performance by including gradient information in the interpolation (a form of gradient-enhanced kriging—GEK) and by introducing a known trend in the global model component (kriging with a trend). Lastly, we propose a mixture of experts (ME) approach, which is based on the divide-and-conquer principle. We validate our surrogate models using aerodynamic data for conventional and unconventional aircraft configurations, and we assess their performance in predicting the mission ranges by analyzing ten mission profiles. Our results show that the proposed ME approach is superior to the traditional models. Using a mixture of GEK models to approximate the drag coefficients gives approximation errors of less than 5{\%} with fewer than 150 samples, whereas the adaptive sampling fails to converge when training a global model. However, when we have a simple function profile, such as the lift and moment coefficients, using a conventional surrogate model is more efficient than an ME model, because of the added computational complexity in the latter. The range estimation errors associated with the ME models are less than 2{\%} for all the benchmark mission profiles considered, whereas some traditional models yield errors as high as 20–80{\%}. We thus conclude that the ME technique is both necessary and sufficient for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients for surrogate-based mission analysis.},

A multi-lobed configuration is employed and the solar irradiance and photovoltaic array model are proposed. After introducing all the parts mass of the hybrid airship and design procedure, an optimal problem with the constraint of energy and the equilibrium between buoyancy and weight are proposed. Through a hybrid optimization search method, the solution is obtained and the sensitivities of geographical location and seasons are discussed. The results show a comprehensive influence of the constraint both in latitude and wind field environment.},

Instead, a source distribution on the body axis was chosen to model the body contour and the correspond- ing inviscid flowfield, with the source strengths being used as design variables for the optimization process. Boundary- layer calculation is performed by means of a proved inte- gral method for attached laminar or turbulent boundary lay- ers. To determine the transition location, a semi-empirical method based on linear stability theory (en-method) was im- plemented recently. A commercially available optimizer as well as an evolution strategy with covariance matrix adaption of the mutation distribution are applied as optimization algo- rithms. Shape optimizations of airship hulls were performed with this new tool for different Reynolds number regimes. The objective was to minimize the drag for a given volume of the envelope and a prescribed airspeed range. The results obtained show a high sensitivity of the optimization result towards the transition criterion used},

abstract = {Input voltage control has been used for improvement of power factor in grid-connected induction generators. However, this method reduces the efficiency drastically due to high output current and control range is also limited. In the proposed scheme both the voltage control and slip control are employed. Two schemes are presented. Scheme-I is used for maximizing efficiency. An optimum voltage and slip control by rotor resistance is applied such that the efficiency is maximized at every operating point. The scheme-II is used for maximizing power factor. A reduced and constant optimum voltage is applied throughout the range of control. The rotor resistance is varied to operate it at desired slip for optimum power-factor. Here power-factor hence the reactive power demand remains nearly constant throughout the range of operation. These schemes are very useful for wind power based generation where wind speed varies over wide range as well as abruptly},

@article{Hussein2016,
abstract = {Surrogate models are effective in reducing the computational time required for solving optimization problems. However, there have been a lukewarm interest in finding multiple trade-off solutions for multi-objective optimization problems using surrogate models. The literature on surrogate modeling for constrained optimization problems is also rare. The dif- ficulty lies in the requirement of building and solving multiple surrogate models, one for each Pareto-optimal solution. In this paper, we first provide a brief introduction of the past stud- ies and suggest a computationally fast, Kriging-based, and generative procedure for finding multiple near Pareto-optimal solutions in a systematic manner. The expected improvement metric is maximized using a real-parameter genetic algorithm for finding new solutions for high-fidelity evaluations. The approach is computationally fast due to the interlinking of building multiple surrogate models and in its systematic sequencing methodology for assist- ing one model with another. In standard two and three-objective test problems with and without constraints, our proposed methodology takes only a few hundreds of high-fidelity solution evaluations to find a widely distributed near Pareto-optimal solutions compared to the standard EMO methods requiring tens of thousands of high-fidelity solution evaluations. The framework is generic and can be extended to utilize other surrogate modeling methods easily.},

abstract = {The "Airships: A New Horizon for Science" study at the Keck Institute for Space Studies investigated the potential of a variety of airships currently operable or under development to serve as observatories and science instrumentation platforms for a range of space, atmospheric, and Earth science. The participants represent a diverse cross-section of the aerospace sector, NASA, and academia. Over the last two decades, there has been wide interest in developing a high altitude, stratospheric lighter-than-air (LTA) airship that could maneuver and remain in a desired geographic position (i.e., "station-keeping") for weeks, months or even years. Our study found considerable scientific value in both low altitude ({\textless} 40 kft) and high altitude ({\textgreater} 60 kft) airships across a wide spectrum of space, atmospheric, and Earth science programs. Over the course of the study period, we identified stratospheric tethered aerostats as a viable alternative to airships where station-keeping was valued over maneuverability. By opening up the sky and Earth's stratospheric horizon in affordable ways with long-term flexibility, airships allow us to push technology and science forward in a project-rich environment that complements existing space observatories as well as aircraft and high-altitude balloon missions.},

abstract = {This paper describes a simulated annealing based multiobjective optimization algorithm that incorporates the concept of archive in order to provide a set of tradeoff solutions for the problem under consideration. To determine the acceptance probability of a new solution vis-a-vis the current solution, an elaborate procedure is followed that takes into account the domination status of the new solution with the current solution, as well as those in the archive. A measure of the amount of domination between two solutions is also used for this purpose. A complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided. An extensive comparative study of the proposed algorithm with two other existing and well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) demonstrate the effectiveness of the former with respect to five existing performance measures, and several test problems of varying degrees of difficulty. In particular, the proposed algorithm is found to be significantly superior for many objective test problems (e.g., 4, 5, 10, and 15 objective problems), while recent studies have indicated that the Pareto ranking-based MOEAs perform poorly for such problems. In a part of the investigation, comparison of the real-coded version of the proposed algorithm is conducted with a very recent multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm, where the performance of the former is found to be generally superior to that of the latter.},

However, this typically results in the need for a significant number of simulations at a variety of design conditions to calculate the objective function. The following paper attempts to address this problem through the application of a multilevel cokriging model within the optimization process. A large number of single-point design simulations are augmented by a smaller number of multipoint simulations. The technique is shown to result in surrogate models as effective as those produced using a traditional multipoint process when optimizing a transonic airfoil but with a reduction in the total number of simulations},

@article{Deb2000,
abstract = {Many real-world search and optimization problems involve inequality and/or equality constraints and are thus posed as constrained optimization problems. In trying to solve constrained optimization problems using genetic algorithms (GAs) or classical optimization methods, penalty function methods have been the most popular approach, because of their simplicity and ease of implementation. However, since the penalty function approach is generic and applicable to any type of constraint (linear or nonlinear), their performance is not always satisfactory. Thus, researchers have developed sophisticated penalty functions specific to the problem at hand and the search algorithm used for optimization. However, the most difficult aspect of the penalty function approach is to find appropriate penalty parameters needed to guide the search towards the constrained optimum. In this paper, GA's population-based approach and ability to make pair-wise comparison in tournament selection operator are exploited to devise a penalty function approach that does not require any penalty parameter. Careful comparisons among feasible and infeasible solutions are made so as to provide a search direction towards the feasible region. Once sufficient feasible solutions are found, a niching method (along with a controlled mutation operator) is used to maintain diversity among feasible solutions. This allows a real-parameter GA's crossover operator to continuously find better feasible solutions, gradually leading the search near the true optimum solution. GAs with this constraint handling approach have been tested on nine problems commonly used in the literature, including an engineering design problem. In all cases, the proposed approach has been able to repeatedly find solutions closer to the true optimum solution than that reported earlier.},

Comparison are performed for their corresponding roof surface temperature, and heat flow for several roof rim angles and also for various wind flow velocities, as well as for different wind directions. Turbulence is modeled by RNG k-?? method and solar radiation distribution over the roof is determined based on an appropriate model applicable to hot arid regions of Iran. Solar radiation is calculated based on the summation of beam and diffuse radiation and ground reflected radiation. For certain inside roof temperature, over all heat transfer to the building is determined with day time for various wind flows and arc shapes and results are compared with flat roof. It was found that various wind flow condition over the vaulted roof makes substantial difference on the convection heat transfer coefficient and finally on the rate of heat transfer to the building with respect to flat roof. Based on heat transfer simulation, roof temperature, heat transfer convection coefficient and heat flow though the vault for different roof arrangement and flat roofs have been determined and advantages of specific vault orientation and wind direction are specified. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It has excellent prediction accuracy with the coefficient of determination of 0.928, the root mean square error of 0.028, and the mean absolute percentage error of 2.68{\%} for the database.

abstract = {The stratosphere airship provides a unique and promising platform for earth observation. Researches on the project design and control scheme for earth observation platforms are still rarely documented. Nonlinear dynamics, model uncertainties, and external disturbances contribute to the difficulty in maneuvering the stratosphere airship. A key technical challenge for the earth observation platform is station keeping, or the ability to remain fixed over a geo­location. This paper investigates the conceptual design, modeling and station­keeping attitude control of the near­space earth observation platform. A conceptual design of the earth observation platform is presented. The dynamics model of the platform is derived from the Newton–Euler formulation, and the station­keeping control system of the platform is formulated. The station­keeping attitude control approach for the platform is proposed. The multi­input multi­output nonlinear control system is decoupled into three single­input single­output linear subsystems via feedback linearization, the attitude controller design is carried out on the new linear systems using terminal sliding mode control, and the global stability of the closed­loop system is proven by using the Lyapunov theorem. The performance of the designed control system is simulated by using the variable step Runge–Kutta integrator. Simulation results show that the control system tracks the commanded attitude with an error of zero, which verify the effectiveness and robustness of the designed control system in the presence of parameter uncertainties. The near­space earth observation platform has several advantages over satellites, such as high resolution, fast to deploy, and convenient to retrieve, and the proposed control scheme provides an effective approach for station­keeping attitude control of the earth observation platform.},

Our objective is to examine the difficulties in building and using kriging models to create accurate global approximations to facilitate multidisciplinary design optimization. Error analysis of the response surface and kriging models is performed, along with a graphical comparison of the approximations. Four optimization problems are also formulated and solved using both sets of approximation models to gain insight into their use for multidisciplinary design optimization. We find that the kriging models, which use only a constant global model and a Gaussian correlation function, yield global approximations that are slightly more accurate than the response surface models.},

abstract = {An optimization strategy is proposed to deal with the aerodynamic/stealthy/structural multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) issue of unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). In applying the strategy, the MDO process is divided into two levels, i.e. system level optimization and subsystem level optimization. The system level optimization is to achieve optimized system objective (or multi-objective) through the adjustment of global external configuration design variables. The subsystem level optimization consists of the aerodynamic/stealthy integrated design and the structural optimization. The aerodynamic/stealthy integrated design aims at achieving the minimum aerodynamic drag coefficient under the constraint of stealthy requirement through the adjustment of local external configuration design variables. The structural optimization is to minimize the structural weight by adjusting the dimensions of structural components. A flowchart to implement this strategy is presented. The MDO for a flying-wing configuration of UCAV is employed to illustrate the detailed process of the optimization. The results indicate that the overall process of the surrogate-based two-level optimization strategy can be implemented automatically, and quite reasonable results are obtained. ?? 2009 Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.},

abstract = {Unmanned systems have ideal characteristics to recognize areas of difficult access, performing missions that could not be made with traditional manned aircraft. Hence, nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology has improved considerably. One of the main drawbacks in the monitoring of an active volcano is the inability to fly between a large gas plumes due to the possible entrance of volcanic ash into the aircraft engine. Accordingly, the physical risk of pilots and scientist that investigate volcanoes aboard of an aircraft is great, if an unexpected event occurs. Under these limitations, a UAV design is proposed for superficial volcano monitoring, with the mission to transmit real time data to a remote location, preventing the exposition of people to these flight conditions. The conceptual design process was carried out with the implementation of a parametric study, using statistical entropy and constraint analysis, in order to determine the minimum value of wing area and thrust required to perform the mission. For the aerodynamic design, analytical studies were developed, through the determination of the aerodynamics, performance and longitudinal stability characteristics. Finally, the aerodynamic coefficients of the wing and the full configuration were evaluated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The numerical results are greatly similar in the lift (CL), drag (CD) and moment (CM) coefficients, when these are compared with the analytical results. Consequently, the results show, on a large scale, as would be the aerodynamic behavior of the UAV performing the established mission.},

abstract = {The use of CFD is widely spread in industry today. However, smaller business have difficulty to make use of this tool, due to high costs for commercial licenses and hard- ware. As SimScale provides the combination of cloud computing with open source CFD software, the prerequisites to use CFD are lowered. To provide more diverse solvers for the platform, different CFD software are integrated onto the platform. As OpenFOAM was the sole CFD software on the platform at the start of this thesis, two other open source software were researched and compared to OpenFOAM. OpenFOAM was compared to Gerris and SU2 in three different validation cases. OpenFOAM and Gerris rotating body capabilities are investigated in an analytical solvable case of laminar Taylor–Couette flow. Two different approaches were used in OpenFOAM, where AMI (Adaptive Mesh Interface) and MRF (Multiple Reference Frame) were used to solve the problem. OpenFOAM and SU2's turbulent capabilities are compared using a turbulent flat plate case from Wieghardt [1]. Compressible transonic flow over a RAE2822 airfoil was set up for OpenFOAM and SU2. The results were compared to data from NASA [2] It was found that the rotating body capabilities (MRF and AMI) of OpenFOAM were suitable for integration onto the SimScale platform. Gerris as a software was deemed to be easy to work with, but would require a new work flow on the platform to be integrated. SU2 was integrated onto the platform during this thesis work, but was deemed to still suffer from some early development issues as its first release was done in January 2013.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of Uncertainty-Based Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (UMDO) theory and the state of the art in UMDO methods for aerospace vehicles. UMDO has been widely acknowledged as an advanced methodology to address competing objectives of aerospace vehicle design, such as performance, cost, reliability and robustness. However the major challenges of UMDO, namely the computational complexity and organizational complexity caused by both time-consuming disciplinary analysis models and UMDO algorithms, still greatly hamper its application in aerospace engineering. In recent years there is a surge of research in this field aiming at solving these problems. The purpose of this paper is to review these existing approaches systematically, highlight research challenges and opportunities, and help guide future efforts. Firstly, the UMDO theory preliminaries are introduced to clarify the basic UMDO concepts and mathematical formulations, as well as provide a panoramic view of the general UMDO solving process. Then following the UMDO solving process, research progress of each key step is separately surveyed and discussed, specifically including uncertainty modeling, uncertainty propagation and analysis, optimization under uncertainty, and UMDO procedure. Finally some conclusions are given, and future research trends and prospects are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {whiB-like genes have been found in all actinomycetes sequenced so far. The amino-acid sequences of WhiB proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv are highly conserved and participate in several cellular functions. Unlike other WhiB proteins of M. tuberculosis that have properties of protein disulfide reductases, WhiB2 showed properties like a chaperone as it suppressed the aggregation of several model substrates (e.g. citrate synthase, rhodanese and luciferase). Suppression of aggregation of the model substrates did not require ATP. Four cysteine residues of WhiB2 form two intramolecular disulfide bonds; however, chaperone function was unaffected by the redox state of the cysteines. WhiB2 also restored the activity of chemically denatured citrate synthase and did not require either ATP or a co-chaperone for refolding. The results indicate that WhiB2, which has been shown to be associated with cell division in mycobacteria and streptomyces, has evolved independently of other WhiBs, although it retains basic properties of this group of proteins. This is the first report to show that a WhiB protein has chaperone-like function; therefore, this report will have major implications in attempts to understand the role of WhiB proteins in mycobacteria, particularly in cell division.},

Experiments were conducted in a shock tube where the investigated balls were suspended, far from all the tube walls, on a very thin wire taken from a spider web. During each experiment, many shadowgraph photos were taken to enable an accurate construction of the sphere's trajectory. Based on the sphere's trajectory, its drag coefficient was evaluated. It was shown that a large difference exists between the sphere drag coefficient in steady and non-steady flows. In the investigated range of Reynolds numbers, the difference exceeds 50{\%}. Based on the obtained results, a correlation for the non-stationary drag coefficient of a sphere is given. This correlation can be used safely in simulating two-phase flows composed of small spherical particles immersed in a gaseous medium.},

abstract = {Most real-world optimization problems involve objectives, constraints, and parameters which constantly change with time. Treating such problems as a stationary optimization problem demand the knowledge of the pattern of change a priori and even then the procedure can be computationally expensive. Although dynamic consideration using evolutionary algorithms has been made for single-objective optimization problems, there has been a lukewarm interest in formulating and solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we modify the commonly-used NSGA-II procedure in tracking a new Pareto-optimal front, as soon as there is a change in the problem. Introduction of a few random solutions or a few mutated solutions are investigated in detail. The approaches are tested and compared on a test problem and a real-world optimization of a hydro-thermal power scheduling problem. This systematic study is able to find a minimum frequency of change allowed in a problem for two dynamic EMO procedures to adequately track Pareto-optimal frontiers on-line. Based on these results, this paper also suggests an automatic decision-making procedure for arriving at a dynamic single optimal solution on-line. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract = {Forced convective heat transfer is one of the major factors that dominate the thermal behaviors of aerostats. Due to the large physical size, the convection around an aerostat has high Reynolds numbers. The existing forced convective heat transfer correlations are limited to the Reynolds number lower than 105, which are not appropriate for aerostat applications. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain a convective heat transfer correlation applicable to spherical aerostats at high Reynolds numbers. In this paper, steady convective heat transfer from an isothermal spherical aerostat is numerically investigated. The numerical simulation is carried out by commercial computational fluid dynamic software with the Reynolds number from 20 to 108. The average Nusselt numbers are obtained and compared with those of available in literature. Based on regression and optimization with software, a new piecewise correlation of Nusselt number is proposed. The verification shows that the new correlation is reliable.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for studying the feasibility of stratosphere airship for high altitude long endurance missions and arriving at the baseline specifications of conventional configuration of stratosphere airship, given the performance and operational requirements. Based on this methodology, the AODAP platform (Airship Optimisation Design and Analysis Platform) was developed. Some innovative concepts used in AODAP that are different from previous methods and codes are presented. The shape optimisation of airship was introduced into the design process, and several optimum objectives can be selected including minimum drag, minimum weight and composite objective based on MDO (Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation). The methodology was validated for other design concepts previously developed for similar missions and also was compared to a low altitude vehicle. The baseline specifications of stratosphere airships designed for various shapes using this methodology are presented. The results of sensitivity analyses for a specified airship are discussed, and the sensitivity of airship length with some critical parameters including area density of envelope fabric, area density of solar cell, efficiency of solar cell and efficiency of fuel cell for the specified shape is also provided.},

abstract = {THE CRAFT OF SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATIONS provides a score of examples from contemporary and historical scientific presentations to show clearly what makes an oral presentation effective. It considers presentations made to persuade an audience to adopt some course of action (such as funding a proposal) as well as presentations made to communicate information, and it considers these from four perspectives: speech, structure, visual aids, and delivery. In keeping with technological innovations, it discusses computer-based projections and slide shows as well as overhead projections. In particular, it discusses ways of organizing graphics and text in projected images and of using layout and design to present the information efficiently and effectively. Unlike other books that discuss technical presentations, this book anchors its advice in the experiences of scientists and engineers, including such successful presenters as Robert Oppenheimer, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Rita Levi-Montalcini, as well as currently active laboratory directors, scientists, and engineers. In addition to examining successful presentations, Alley also discusses the errors that cause many scientific presentations to flounder, providing a list of ten critical errors to avoid. The insights and tools in this book will guide readers to deliver outstanding presentations. Praise for Michael Alley's THE CRAFT OF SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATIONS: "Alley has revamped the way our research center makes the way we design our presentation slides." DANIEL J.

By using the NOAA NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data base we analyze the monthly average wind velocity at 200 mb for a 16 year period, for two sites in Mexico: Sierra Negra and San Pedro M$\backslash$'artir. We compare the results with those obtained for Mauna Kea, Paranal and La Silla, with Maidanak in Uzbekistan, and with Gamsberg in Namibia. We show that for all the sites under study there is a yearly wind speed modulation and we model that modulation. Our results show that Sierra Negra and San Pedro M$\backslash$'artir are comparable with the best observatory sites as Mauna Kea and are amongst the most advantageous sites to apply adaptive optics techniques.},

This function implements a Runge-Kutta method with a variable time step for efficient computation. ode45 is designed to handle the following general problem: dx dt = f (t, x), x(t 0) = x 0 , (1) where t is the independent variable, x is a vector of dependent variables to be found and f (t, x) is a function of t and x. The mathematical problem is specified when the vector of functions on the right-hand side of Eq. (1), f (t, x), is set and the initial conditions, x = x 0 at time t 0 are given. In ME175, the solution is often not complete once you have solved the problem and obtained the ode's governing the systems motion. It is often beneficial to produce a visual representation of what exactly the trajectories of a particle represented by a highly complicated looking ordinary differential equation looks like and the following is a brief explanation of how to accomplish this.},

@article{Queipo2002,
abstract = {This paper presents a solution methodology for the optimization of geometrical and operational parameters of SAGD processes in a heterogeneous and multiphase petroleum reservoir. The optimization refers to the maximization or minimization of performance measures such as net present value, cumulative oil production, or cumulative steam injected. The solution methodology includes the construction of a "fast surrogate" of an objective function whose evaluation involves the execution of a time-consuming mathematical model (i.e. reservoir numerical simulator) based on neural networks. DACE modeling, and adaptive sampling. Using adaptive sampling, promising areas are searched considering the information provided by the surrogate model and the expected value of the errors. The proposed methodology provides a global optimization method, hence avoiding the potential problem of convergence to a local minimum in the objective function exhibited by the commonly Gauss Newton methods. Furthermore, it exhibits an affordable computational cost, is amenable to parallel processing, and is expected to outperform other general-purpose global optimization methods such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and pattern search methods. The methodology is evaluated using a case study with the vertical spacing, steam-injected enthalpy, injection pressure, and subcooling as the sought parameter values in a SAGD process that optimize a weighted sum of cumulative oil production and cumulative steam injected for a selected reservoir. From the results, it is concluded that the methodology can be used effectively and efficiently for the optimization of SAGD processes. In addition, the optimization approach holds promise to be useful in the optimization of objective functions involving the execution of computationally expensive reservoir numerical simulators, such as those found not only in oil recovery processes, but also in other areas of petroleum engineering (e.g. hydraulic fracturing). ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Liem2015,
abstract = {The accurate evaluation of aircraft fuel burn over a complete mission is computationally expensive and may require millions of aerodynamic performance evaluations. Thus, it is advantageous to use surrogate models as approximations of high-fidelity aerodynamic or aerostructural models. Conventional surrogate models, such as the radial basis function and kriging, cannot model these functions accurately, especially in the transonic regime. To address this issue, we explore several ways to improve the accuracy of surrogate models. First, we employ an adaptive sampling algorithm to complement a traditional space-filling algorithm. Second, we improve the kriging surrogate performance by including gradient information in the interpolation (a form of gradient-enhanced kriging-GEK) and by introducing a known trend in the global model component (kriging with a trend). Lastly, we propose a mixture of experts (ME) approach, which is based on the divide-and-conquer principle. We validate our surrogate models using aerodynamic data for conventional and unconventional aircraft configurations, and we assess their performance in predicting the mission ranges by analyzing ten mission profiles. Our results show that the proposed ME approach is superior to the traditional models. Using a mixture of GEK models to approximate the drag coefficients gives approximation errors of less than 5{\%} with fewer than 150 samples, whereas the adaptive sampling fails to converge when training a global model. However, when we have a simple function profile, such as the lift and moment coefficients, using a conventional surrogate model is more efficient than an ME model, because of the added computational complexity in the latter. The range estimation errors associated with the ME models are less than 2{\%} for all the benchmark mission profiles considered, whereas some traditional models yield errors as high as 20-80{\%}. We thus conclude that the ME technique is both necessary and sufficient for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients for surrogate-based mission analysis.},

abstract = {The present article shows a new methodology of calculation of the direct, diffuse and reflected incident solar radiation, in all type of surfaces, either in open urban environments or inside buildings. This methodology is applicable in problems related to solar access (space heating in buildings, shadowing of open spaces), solar gains (space cooling in buildings), and daylighting. Solar radiation is the most important contribution to the surface and volumetric energy balance during the daytime. Particularly, solar radiation is the main contributor to heat gains in buildings, especially in residential buildings, where internal gains are very low. Utilization of daylight in buildings may result in significant savings in electricity consumption for lighting while creating a higher quality indoor environment. Additional energy savings may also be realized during cooling season, when reduction of internal heat gains due to electric lighting results in a corresponding reduction of cooling energy consumption. The analysis of the existing calculation methods and proposed in the scientific bibliography for the calculation of the solar radiation in problems of solar access in winter, solar gains in summer, and daylighting, takes us to the necessity of outlining a new and complete methodology. This new methodology is applicable to all these problems with a great accuracy and calculation speed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

At the experimental stand a thick copper plate protected the solar cell from overheating, the plate working as a radiation heat sink, or also as the cell temperature stabilizer during heating it up to 80??C. A decrease of the output power (-0.65{\%}/K), of the fill-factor (-0.2{\%}/K) and of the conversion efficiency (-0.08{\%}/K) of the PV module with the temperature increase has been observed. The spectral characteristic of the open-circuit voltage of the single-crystalline silicon solar cell is also presented. It is shown that the radiation-rate coefficient of the short-circuit current-limit of the solar cell at 28??C is 1.2{\%}/(mW/cm2). ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent years, the study of semi-rigid airship has revived with the development of airships. Semi-rigid airships have some characteristics of rigid airships and non-rigid airships. Due to the flexibility of the envelope of the non-rigid airship, the variation of the temperature of the inner gas will lead to its structure deformation and affect its flight altitude. This paper develops the structural mechanics model, thermodynamic model and dynamic model of the semi-rigid airship, based on which nonlinear finite element analysis is employed for geometrically nonlinear deformation of the airship upper film in consideration of thermodynamics and structural mechanics coupling. Based on the thermal-structural interaction, the thermal characteristics and flight performances of the airship during floating flight are investigated. The 3-D solar radiation and temperature distribution of the airship skin and the temperature variation of the inner gas are presented to investigate the thermal performance of the airship, flight velocity, acceleration and flight altitude are simulated to investigate the flight performance, and the variations of the volume and pressure difference of the inner gas are calculated to provide a basis for structure design. The results of the simulation can be referenced for the design of the semi-rigid airship, and can be used for the further study on the attitude control of the airship during its floating flight. ?? 2012 COSPAR.

abstract = {Having developed multi-objective optimization algorithms using evolutionary optimization methods and demonstrated their niche on various practical problems involving mostly two and three objectives, there is now a growing need for developing evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms for handling many-objective (having four or more objectives) optimization problems. In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point based many-objective NSGA-II (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members which are non-dominated yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems having two to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this study. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.},

abstract = {Wing shape is one of the main drivers of aircraft aerodynamic performance, so most aerodynamic shape optimization efforts have focused solely on the wing. However, the performance of the full aircraft configuration must account for the fact that the aircraft needs to be trimmed. Thus, to realize the full benefit of aerodynamic shape optimization, one should optimize the wing shape while including the full configuration and a trim constraint. To evaluate the benefit of this approach, we perform the aerodynamic shape optimization of the Common Research Model wing–body–tail configuration using gradient-based optimization with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model that includes a discrete adjoint implementation. We investigate the aerodynamic shape optimization of the wing with a trim constraint that is satisfied by rotating the horizontal tail. We then optimize the same wing–body configuration without the tail but with an added trim drag penalty based on a surrogate model we created before the optimization...},

abstract = {Optimal batch plant design is a recurrent issue in Process Engineering, which can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) optimisation problem involving specific constraints, which can be, typically, the respect of a time horizon for the synthesis of various products. Genetic Algorithms constitute a common option for the solution of these problems, but their basic operating mode is not always well-suited to any kind of constraint treatment: if those cannot be integrated in variable encoding or accounted for through adapted genetic operators, their handling turns to be a thorny issue. The point of this study is thus to test a few constraint handling techniques on a mid-size example in order to determine which one is the best fitted, in the framework of one particular problem formulation. The investigated methods are the elimination of infeasible individuals, the use of a penalty term added in the minimized criterion, the relaxation of the discrete variables upper bounds, dominance-based tournaments and, finally, a multiobjective strategy. The numerical computations, analysed in terms of result quality and of computational time, show the superiority of elimination technique for the former criterion only when the latter one does not become a bottleneck. Besides, when the problem complexity makes the random location of feasible space too difficult, a single tournament technique proves to be the most efficient one. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper we present a new robust approach for minimizing the fuel burn of aircraft configurations using numerical optimization. Our focus is on performing a multi-point aerostructural optimization that considers the performance at multiple flight conditions simultaneously and is representative of all the missions flown by a given aircraft model. The goal is to avoid severe performance degradation at off-design conditions and missions, which typically occurs when performing single-point optimization. Specifically, we aim to design a fuel-efficient long-range aircraft configuration. The robustness is introduced by considering hundreds of missions within the operational flight envelope of similarly-sized aircraft, based on historical data of actual flight operations. Due to the large computational cost associated with the high-fidelity multidisciplinary analysis, kriging surrogate models are employed to allow thousands of detailed flight analyses to be performed while limiting the number of high-fidelity evaluations. The methodology is demonstrated in a fuel burn minimization problem of a long-range wide-body aircraft configuration. A single-point optimization is performed for comparison purposes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-point optimization procedure. The multi-point optimized design consistently reduces the fuel burn acrossthe flight conditions, whereas the fuel burn reduction observed in the single-point optimization case is localized. Consequently, we see a more significant fuel burn reduction in the multi-point optimization case, as compared to the single-point one.},

abstract = {Part of the sunlight energy received by the solar array on the stratospheric airship surface is converted to electric energy, and considerable energy is transformed into heat, which is bad for the envelope material and the internal pressure of the airship. It is necessary to develop different methods for the solar array to reduce its thermal effects on the stratospheric airship. Coating film, heat dissipation structure and heat insulation structure are developed to reduce the thermal effects. A series of theoretical studies are carried out to analyze the effects of three layers, especially the heat dissipation structure made up by arrayed fins, which are verified by the experimental test and CFD simulation. As for the solar array system, the mutual coordination among output power, thermal protection effect and the structure weight ought to be considered at the same time in the design of solar array system of the stratospheric airship.},

abstract = {Using response surface approximationsfor design constraints in design optimizationprovides the designer with an overall perspective of the system response within the design space. Response surface approximations also re- duce the numerical noise inherent inmanynumericalmodels and simplify the process of integrating several design codes, as is typically required inmultidisciplinaryoptimization.Procedures are discussed for constructing accurate response surface approximationsto represent design constraints in designoptimization.Response surface approxi- mationsare constructed for the stresses and bucklingloads of an isotropic plate with an abrupt change of thickness. These response surface approximations are constructed from numerical experiments conducted with a ? nite ele- ment analysisprocedure and are used forminimum-weightoptimumdesign of the plate. Nondimensionalvariables and stepwise regression are used to reduce the complexity and increase the accuracy of the response surface ap- proximations.Additionally,higher-order polynomials(cubic andquartic insteadof themore traditionalquadratic) are used as response surface approximations,and a detailed error analysis, using an independent data set, is per- formed. Finally, it is shown that, by making use of response surface approximations, the optimum weight of the platemay be presented in the form of a design chart for a wide range of geometric, loading,andmaterial constants.

This paper introduces a general class of continuous multiobjective optimization test instances with arbitrary prescribed PS shapes, which could be used for studying the ability of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for dealing with complicated PS shapes. It also proposes a new version of MOEA/D based on differential evolution (DE), i.e., MOEA/D-DE, and compares the proposed algorithm with NSGA-II with the same reproduction operators on the test instances introduced in this paper. The experimental results indicate that MOEA/D could significantly outperform NSGA-II on these test instances.

abstract = {This paper describes the Multi Disciplinary Optimization of an airship with unconventional configuration. The shape of the airship is based upon two semi-ellipsoids, whose axis ratios can be altered for optimization purpose. The parameters to optimize are: volume, ratio between longitudinal and lateral semi-axis, ratio between vertical and lateral semi-axis, percentage of the top surface covered by photovoltaic films, dimension of the tail. The goals of the optimization are: equilibrium between buoyancy and weight, reaching of the design speed, static longitudinal stability of the vehicle. The mathematical model developed to evaluate airship features includes the computation of the ballonet volume, a weight breakdown, the energy storage for night operations, the power system evaluation and stability considerations. Six heuristic optimization strategies have been applied in order to achieve the best solution; some case studies have been developed and the final optimal configurations found by algorithms have been analyzed in order to validate the optimization framework. The approach demonstrate that the heuristic optimization strategies used are good tool for the conceptual design of unconventional airship since this problem requires a multi-disciplinary approach and several parameters including aerodynamics, propulsion, mass breakdown, aerostatics and stability, which are strongly dependent each other, must be jointly considered and addressed at the same time to obtain an optimum and balanced design},

@article{Aarts2005,
abstract = {Many problems in engineering, planning and manufacturing can be modeled as that of minimizing or maximizing a cost function over a finite set of discrete variables. This class of so-called combinatorial optimization problems has received much attention over the last two decades and major achievements have been made in its analysis ( Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 1982 ). One of these achievements is the separation of this class into two subclasses. The first one contains the problems that can be solved efficiently, i.e. problems for which algorithms are known that solve each instance to optimality in polynomial time. Examples are linear programming, matching and network problems. The second subclass contains the problems that are notoriously hard, formally referred to as NP-hard (see Chapter 11 for more details). For an NP-hard algorithm it is generally believed that no algorithm exists that solves each instance in polynomial time. Consequently, there are instances that require superpolynomial or exponential time to be solved to optimality. Many known problems belong to this class and probably the best known example is the traveling salesman problem. The above-mentioned distinction is supported by a general framework in computer science called complexity theory; for a detailed introduction and an extensive listing of provably hard problems see Garey and Johnson (1979) and Ausiello et al. (1999).},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of initial efforts to apply the System Sensitivity Analysis (SSA) optimization method to the conceptual design of a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicle. SSA is an efficient, calculus-based MDO technique for generating sensitivity derivatives in a highly multidisciplinary design environment. The method has been successfully applied to conceptual aircraft design and has been proven to have advantages over traditional direct optimization methods. The method is applied to the optimization of an advanced, piloted SSTO design similar to vehicles currently being analyzed by NASA as possible replacements for the Space Shuttle. Powered by a derivative of the Russian RD-701 rocket engine, the vehicle employs a combination of hydrocarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen propellants. Three primary disciplines are included in the design propulsion, performance, and weights {\&} sizing. A complete, converged vehicle analysis depends on the use of three standalone conceptual analysis computer codes. Efforts to minimize vehicle dry (empty) weight are reported in this paper. The problem consists of six system-level design variables and one system- level constraint. Using SSA in a manual fashion to generate gradient information, six system-level iterations were performed from each of two different starting points. The results showed a good pattern of convergence for both starting points. A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the method, possible areas of improvement, and future work is included.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The stratospheric satellite has attracted much attention due to its potential application in military and economy. In this paper, a novel dynamic model with thermal effects is addressed to describe thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the stratospheric satellite. By using the iterative calculation of multi-body dynamics system, the equilibrium point of the stratospheric satellite is received. The computational accuracy is improved and the computational quantity is reduced enormously by setting initial values of several parameters in advance. Based on the dynamic simulation, influences of the trajectory control system on meridional migration of the stratospheric satellite are analyzed. It improves the controllability and security of the stratospheric satellite effectively. Thermal effects on the system flight performance are simulated under given launch conditions. Simulation results show that choice of launch time should be made with reference to launch location for making best use of solar radiation. The best launch time is at sunset, because solar energy can be used to accelerate and at the end of ascent phase solar radiation basically disappears which will lead to lower differential pressure.},

The model can be used to study the effect of solar radiation, ambient wind, and altitude and location of deployment of the airship on the temperature of buoy-ant gas and solar array of the airship. The solar array is modeled as three layers, viz., outer layer, solar cell and substrate, and the heat transfer equations involving radiative, infra-red, convective and conductive heat are solved simultaneously using a standard fourth order Runge-Kutta Method. The model has been coded in MATLAB {\textregistered} , and can be easily integrated to a multidisciplinary design optimization framework. Using this model, the variation of temperature with time for a stratospheric airship was obtained, and a good match was seen with some experimental data and numerical results quoted in literature. The effect of some operational parameters, viz., deployment location, altitude and ambient wind speed are presented to illustrate their effect.},

This paper outlines a numerical model including the thermal model of airship and solar cells, the incident solar radiation model on the solar array, and the power output model. Based on this numerical model, a MATLAB computer program is developed. In the course of the investigation, the comparisons of the simulation results with and without considering thermal effect are reported. Furthermore, effects of the transmissivity of external encapsulation layer of solar array and wind speed on the thermal performance and output power of solar array are discussed in detail. The results indicate that this method is helpful for planning energy management.},

@article{Gueymard1995,
abstract = {An upgraded spectral radiation model called SMARTS2 is introduced. The solar shortwave direct beam irradiance is calculated from spectral transmittance functions for the main extinction processes in the cloudless atmosphere: Rayleigh scattering, aerosol extinction, and absorption by ozone, uniformly mixed gases, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide. Temperature-dependent or pressure-dependent extinction coefficients have been developed for all these absorbing gases, based on recent spectroscopic data obtained either directly from the experimental literature or, in a preprocessed form, from MODTRAN2, a state-of-the-art rigorous code. The NO2 extinction effect, in both the UV and visible, is introduced for the first time in a simple spectral model. Aerosol extinction is evaluated using a two-tier Angstr{\"{o}}m approach. Parameterizations of the wavelength exponents, single-scattering coefficient, and asymmetry factor for different aerosol models (proposed by Shettle and Fenn, Braslau and Dave, and also in the Standard Radiation Atmosphere) are provided as a function of both wavelength and relative humidity. Moreover, aerosol turbidity can now be estimated from airport visibility data using a function based on the Shettle and Fenn aerosol model. An improved approximation to the extraterrestrial solar spectrum, treated at 1 nm intervals between 280 and 1700 nm, and 5 nm intervals between 1705 and 4000 nm, is based on recent satellite data in the UV and visible. The total irradiance between 280 and 4000 nm (1349.5 W/m2) is obtained without scaling and is in good agreement with the currently accepted value of the solar constant (1367 W/m2). Incident diffuse radiation and global radiation for any plane orientation at ground level are also calculated by the model, with provision for both multiple scattering effects and ozone absorption intricacies in the UV. SMARTS2 also has an optional circumsolar correction function and two filter smoothing functions which together allow the simulation of actual spectroradiometers. This facilitates comparison between modelled results and measured data. Detailed performance assessment of the model is provided. It consists of prediction comparisons between the proposed model and rigorous radiative transfer models for different specific atmo- spheric conditions in the UV, visible, and near IR. High quality measured datasets in the UV and in the intervals 290–620 nm and 300–1100 nm are also used to validate the model by direct com- parison. The resultant overall accuracy appears a significant improvement over existing simpli- fied models, particularly in the UV. Therefore, SMARTS2 can be used in a variety of applica- tions to predict full terrestrial spectra under any cloudless atmospheric condition.},

abstract = {A stable, ultra long-duration high-altitude balloon (HAB) platform which can maintain stationary position would represent a new paradigm for telecommunications and high-altitude observation and transmission services, with greatly reduced cost and complexity compared to existing technologies including satellites, telecom towers, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This contribution proposes a lightweight superpressure balloon platform for deployment to an altitude of 25??km. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrusters are presented to maintain position by overcoming stratospheric winds. Critical to maintaining position is a continual supply of electrical power to operate the on-board propulsion system. One viable solution is to deliver power wirelessly to a high-altitude craft from a ground-based transmitter. Microwave energy, not heavily attenuated by the atmosphere, can be provided remotely from a ground-based generator (magnetron, klystron, etc.) and steered electrically with an antenna array (phased array) at a designated frequency (such as 2.45 or 5.8??GHz). A rectifying antenna (???rectenna???) on the bottom of the balloon converts waves into direct current for on-board use. Preliminary mission architecture, energy requirements, and safety concerns for a proposed system are presented along with recommended future work.},

abstract = {Since the first edition was published, computers have become ever more powerful, design engineers are tackling more complex systems, and the term "optimization" is now routinely used to denote a design process with increased speed and quality. This second edition takes account of these developments and brings the original text thoroughly up to date. The book now discusses trust region and convex approximation algorithms. A new chapter focuses on how to construct optimal design models. Three new case studies illustrate the creation of optimization models. The final chapter on optimization practice has been expanded to include computation of derivatives, interpretation of algorithmic results, and selection of algorithms and software.},

abstract = {Simulated annealing is a probabilistic method proposed in Kirkpatrick, Gelett and Vecchi (1983) and Cerny (1985) for finding the global minimum of a cost function that may possess several local minima. It works by emulating the physical process whereby a solid is slowly cooled so that when eventually its structure is "frozen," this happens at a minimum energy configuration. We restrict ourselves to the case of a cost function defined on a finite set. Extensions of simulated annealing to the case of functions defined on continuous sets have also been introduced in the literature (e.g., Geman and Hwang, 1986; Gidas, 1985a; Holley, Kusuoka and Stroock, 1989; Jeng and Woods, 1990; Kushner, 1985). Our goal in this review is to describe the method, its convergence and its behavior in applications.},

abstract = {Differential equations can describe nearly all systems undergoing change. They are widespread in physics, engineering, economics, social science, but also in biology. Many mathematicians have studied the nature of these equations andmany complicated systems can be described quite precisely with mathematical expressions. However, many systems involving differential equations may be complex (nonlinear) and can count several cou- pled equations. Thus, a purely mathematical analysis is often not possible. Computer simulations and numerical approximations are then needed. The techniques for solving differential equations based on numerical approximations were developed long before programmable computers existed. It was common to see equations solved in rooms of people working onmechanical calculators. As computers have increased in speed and decreased in cost, increasingly complex systems of differential equations can be solved on a common computer. Currently, your laptop could compute the long term trajectories of about 1 million interacting molecules with relative ease, a problem that was inaccessible to the fastest supercomputers some 10 years ago.},

@article{Kale2005a,
abstract = {Aerostat envelopes are generally bodies of revolution with length to diameter ratio ranging from 3 to 5. Drag coefficient for this class of bodies can be obtained using empirical formulae or co-relations based on experimental studies. However such formulae are valid for specific class of envelope shapes only and result in errors of around 30{\%} compared to the values determined by numerical methods. The motivation for the present study arose from the need for a simple but generic methodology to estimate coefficient of drag as a function of envelope geometry, thus eliminating the need for running numerically expensive CFD codes each time the shape is altered during an optimisation exercise. In a previous study, the envelop shape was parameterized in terms of six geometric coefficients, and a shape generation algorithm was developed to generate various possible shapes satisfying manufacturing and few geometric design constraints. An empirical co-relation for envelope drag coefficient was developed, but it was not amenable to coupling with an MDO process, since it required detailed geometric data about the envelope shape, especially the coordinates of several points at the nose and trailing edge, and the grid density in these regions. In the present study, around 600 feasible shapes satisfying the user-specified volume and length constraints were generated using the shape generation algorithm. The flow patterns over these shapes were studied using FLUENT™ CFD Package and a better corelation was obtained by fitting a quadratic response surface using Design-Expert™ package. The current methodology uses only the values of six design variables to determine the drag coefficient, thus making it easy to integrate with a multi-disciplinary optimization algorithm for determining optimum envelope shape.

@article{Queipo2005,
abstract = {A major challenge to the successful full-scale development of modern aerospace systems is to address competing objectives such as improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced safety. Accurate, high-fidelity models are typically time consuming and computationally expensive. Furthermore, informed decisions should be made with an understanding of the impact (global sensitivity) of the design variables on the different objectives. In this context, the so-called surrogate-based approach for analysis and optimization can play a very valuable role. The surrogates are constructed using data drawn from high-fidelity models, and provide fast approximations of the objectives and constraints at new design points, thereby making sensitivity and optimization studies feasible. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the fundamental issues that arise in surrogate-based analysis and optimization (SBAO), highlighting concepts, methods, techniques, as well as practical implications. The issues addressed include the selection of the loss function and regularization criteria for constructing the surrogates, design of experiments, surrogate selection and construction, sensitivity analysis, convergence, and optimization. The multi-objective optimal design of a liquid rocket injector is presented to highlight the state of the art and to help guide future efforts. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Solar radiation received and absorbed by four domed roofs was estimated and compared with that of a flat roof. The domed roofs all had the same base areas, and equal to that of the flat roof. One of the roofs considered was the dome of the St. Peter's Church in Rome. Compared with the other roofs considered, this dome had a higher aspect ratio. It was found that all domed roofs received more solar radiation than the flat roof. Considering glazed tiles to cover a selected dome in Iran and the dome of the St. Peter's Church, it was found that the solar radiation absorbed by these roofs is reduced appreciably. In the case of the dome of St. Peter's Church, the amount of radiation absorbed was roughly equal to that absorbed by the comparable flat roof in the warm months. In the case of the glazed reference dome located in Yazd, Iran (a city with very high solar radiation), the radiation absorbed was less than that of flat roof at all times. In addition to aesthetics, this may be a reason for employing glazed tiles to cover the domes of all mosques, shrines, and other large buildings in Iran. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Emphasis is placed on the detailed validation for a range of flow cases designed to assess the predictive capability of the method. Several fundamental flow cases are presented including tip flows, blade-vortex interaction and three- dimensional dynamic stall. Solutions for isolated rotors are also obtained both at hover and forward flight conditions. The detailed validation of the method for fundamental flows was found to be beneficial when more complex cases were considered like the flow around a helicopter fuselage or the rotor/fuselage interaction. Throughout, experimental data available in the public domain has been used and a substantial validation database has been compiled. Overall, the method was found capable of capturing the basic flow characteristics, however, the need for detailed experimental data has been identified as a number one priority in order to assess the method in predicting the interactions between the main rotor the fuselage and the tail rotor at a wide range of conditions},

abstract = {A new dynamics modeling approach is proposed for flexible airships, which integrates the flight dynamics, structural dynamics, aerostatics, and aerodynamics. In particular, a comprehensive aerodynamic computation is presented, including the potential-flow aerodynamics, the viscous effects, the forces on the fins, the forces on the hull due to the fins, and the axial drag. The coupling between flexibility and aerodynamics is incorporated through the local velocity of the deformed airship. The resulting dynamics model is represented by a single set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, describing the rigid-body motion, the elastic deformation, and the coupling between them. This model has been implemented and used to simulate the Skyship-500 airship. Simulation results demonstrate the effects of structural flexibility on the aerodynamic and dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. These results reveal that strong coupling exists between the roll rotation and the bending deflection in the lateral plane, and that the natural frequencies of the airship in air are much lower than those in vacuum. In addition, the nonlinear dynamics model is numerically linearized to investigate the aeroelastic stability of the airship.

abstract = {The use of kriging models for approximation and metamodel-based design and optimization has been steadily on the rise in the past decade. The widespread use of kriging models appears to be hampered by 1) computationally efficient algorithms for accurately estimating the models parameters, 2) an effective method to assess the resulting models quality, and 3) the lack of guidance in selecting the appropriate form of the kriging model.We attempt to address these issues by comparing 1) maximum likelihood estimation and cross validation parameter estimation methods for selecting a kriging models parameters given its form and 2) an R2 of prediction and the corrected Akaike information criterion assessment methods for quantifying the quality of the created kriging model. These methods are demonstrated with six test problems. Finally, different forms of kriging models are examined to determine if more complex forms are more accurate and easier to fit than simple forms of kriging models for approximating computer models.},

abstract = {A steady state model of the temperature regime of airships and hot air balloons shells is developed. The model includes three governing equations: the equation of the temperature field of airships or balloons shell, the integral equation for the radiative fluxes on the internal surface of the shell, and the integral equation for the natural convective heat exchange between the shell and the internal gas. In the model the following radiative fluxes on the shell external surface are considered: the direct and the earth reflected solar radiation, the diffuse solar radiation, the infrared radiation of the earth surface and that of the atmosphere. For the calculations of the infrared external radiation the model of the plane layer of the atmosphere is used. The convective heat transfer on the external surface of the shell is considered for the cases of the forced and the natural convection. To solve the mentioned set of the equations the numerical iterative procedure is developed. The model and the numerical procedure are used for the simulation study of the temperature fields of an airship shell under the forced and the natural convective heat transfer. (Author)},

This paper surveys recent publications in the field of aerospace, in which the interest in MDO has been particularly intense. The primary c hallenges in MDO are computational expense and organizational complexity. Accordingly, this survey focuses on various methods used by different researchers to address these challenges. The survey is organized by a breakdown of MDO into its conceptual components, reflected in sections on mathematical modelling, approximation concepts, optimization procedures, system sensitivity, and human interface. Because the authors' primary area of expertise is in the structures discipline, the majority of the references focus on the interaction of this discipline with others. In particular, two sections at the end of this review focus on two interactions that have recently been pursued with vigour: the simultaneous optimization of structures and aerodynamics and the simultaneous optimization of structures with active control.},

@article{Loth2008,
abstract = {The drag of a non-spherical particle was reviewed and investigated for a variety of shapes (regular and irregular) and particle Reynolds numbers (Rep). Point-force models for the trajectory-averaged drag were discussed for both the Stokes regime (Rep ??? 1) and Newton regime (Rep ??? 1 and sub-critical with approximately constant drag coefficient) for a particular particle shape. While exact solutions were often available for the Stokes regime, the Newton regime depended on: aspect ratio for spheroidal particles, surface area ratio for other regularly-shaped particles, and min-med-max area for irregularly shaped particles. The combination of the Stokes and Newton regimes were well integrated using a general method by Ganser (developed for isometric shapes and disks). In particular, a modified Clift-Gauvin expression was developed for particles with approximately cylindrical cross-sections relative to the flow, e.g. rods, prolate spheroids, and oblate spheroids with near-unity aspect ratios. However, particles with non-circular cross-sections exhibited a weaker dependence on Reynolds number, which is attributed to the more rapid transition to flow separation and turbulent boundary layer conditions. Their drag coefficient behavior was better represented by a modified Dallavalle drag model, by again integrating the Stokes and Newton regimes. This paper first discusses spherical particle drag and classification of particle shapes, followed by the main body which discusses drag in Stokes and Newton regimes and then combines these results for the intermediate regimes. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A special and effective aerodynamics calculation method has been applied for the flow field around a body of revolution to find the drag coefficient for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The body profile is described by a first order continuous axial singularity distribution. The solution of the direct problem then gives the radius and inviscid velocity distribution. Viscous effects are considered by means of an integral boundary layer procedure, and for determination of the transition location the forced transition criterion is applied. By avoiding those profiles, which result in the separation of the boundary layer, the drag can be calculated at the end of the body by using Young's formula. In this study, a powerful optimization procedure known as a Genetic Algorithms (GA) is used for the first time in the shape optimization of airship hulls. GA represents a particular artificial intelligence technique for large spaces, striking a remarkable balance between exploration and exploitation of search space. This method could reach to minimum objective function through a better path, and also could minimize the drag coefficient faster for different Reynolds number regimes},

abstract = {Surrogate modeling uses cheap “surrogates” to represent the response surface of simulation models. It involves several steps, including initial sampling, regression and adaptive sampling. This study evaluates an adaptive surrogate modeling based optimization (ASMO) method on two benchmark problems: the Hartman function and calibration of the SAC-SMA hydrologic model. Our results show that: 1) Gaussian Processes are the best surrogate model construction method. A minimum Interpolation Surface method is the best adaptive sampling method. Low discrepancy Quasi Monte Carlo methods are the most suitable initial sampling designs. Some 15–20 times the dimension of the problem may be the proper initial sample size; 2) The ASMO method is much more efficient than the widely used Shuffled Complex Evolution global optimization method. However, ASMO can provide only approximate optimal solutions, whose precision is limited by surrogate modeling methods and problem-specific features; and 3) The identifiability of model parameters is correlated with parameter sensitivity.},

It may result in permanent damage to academic career. This paper provides advice how to prevent or treat this condition. METHODS: Prepare your manuscript following the IMRaD principle (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion), with every part supporting the key message. When writing, be concise. Clearly state your methods here, while data belong to Results. Successful submissions combine quality new data or new thinking with lucid presentation. RESULTS: Provide data that answer the research question. Describe here most important numeric data and statistics, keeping in mind that the shorter you can present them, the better. The scientific community screens abstracts to decide which full text papers to read. Make your point with data, not arguments. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions have to be based on the present study findings. The time of lengthy and unfounded speculations is over. A simple message in a clearly written manuscript will get noticed and may advance our understanding of stroke.},

abstract = {Multi-objective formulations are realistic models for many complex engineering optimization problems. In many real-life problems, objectives under consideration conflict with each other, and optimizing a particular solution with respect to a single objective can result in unacceptable results with respect to the other objectives. A reasonable solution to a multi-objective problem is to investigate a set of solutions, each of which satisfies the objectives at an acceptable level without being dominated by any other solution. In this paper, an overview and tutorial is presented describing genetic algorithms (GA) developed specifically for problems with multiple objectives. They differ primarily from traditional GA by using specialized fitness functions and introducing methods to promote solution diversity. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Experimental and theoretical studies are reported on the thermal insulation performance of three types of lightweight substrate for application in solar array on stratospheric airships. A concept, specific temperature difference, is proposed which expresses temperature difference of unit area density and can estimate the overall thermal insulation performance of lightweight substrate. The experimental apparatus and instrumentation have been designed and built to measure temperature difference between the upper and lower surface of the test samples under different solar radiation flux conditions. The experimental data are studied to assess thermal insulation performance of the lightweight substrates. The theoretical models of three types of insulation structures are investigated to predict the temperatures. Then, the models are verified by comparison with the experimental data. On the basis of analyzing theoretical models, the effects of two critical parameters of the heat sink substrate on thermal insulation performance are analyzed which give the most important evidences for optimizing the design of heat sink substrate. The obtained result is a valuable reference for the selection of insulation substrate of solar array on stratospheric airships.},

Instead, a source distribution on the body axis was chosen to model the body contour and the correspond- ing inviscid flowfield, with the source strengths being used as design variables for the optimization process. Boundary- layer calculation is performed by means of a proved inte- gral method for attached laminar or turbulent boundary lay- ers. To determine the transition location, a semi-empirical method based on linear stability theory (en-method) was im- plemented recently. A commercially available optimizer as well as an evolution strategy with covariance matrix adaption of the mutation distribution are applied as optimization algo- rithms. Shape optimizations of airship hulls were performed with this new tool for different Reynolds number regimes. The objective was to minimize the drag for a given volume of the envelope and a prescribed airspeed range. The results obtained show a high sensitivity of the optimization result towards the transition criterion used},

abstract = {This paper aims at defining a design methodology for the global thermodynamic performance of a high altitude airship cabin. This design method applies to different systems, which could not use the traditional air conditioning plant layout based on bleed air intake from the compressor stage of jet engines. In the case of electrically propelled green vehicles and airships, other energy sources must be exploited. The MAAT EU FP7 project presents an innovative, energetically self sufficient, airship system based on cruiser-feeder architecture. Both the cruiser and feeder are fed by photovoltaic energy. The energy storage system by electrolysis and fuel cells with intermediate energy storage by hydrogen and oxygen is characterized by high temperature energy dispersions (about 800-1000??C for High temperature SOFC cells). This situation encourages the definition of a novel pressurization and air conditioning system. A preliminary cabin sizing with some structural considerations, an energetic evaluation of the thermal insulation of the cabin and a general balance of the energy production system are provided. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

A full modeling approach that includes the computation of aerodynamics of airship and the added mass for the nonlinear dynamics simulation of stratosphere airships is proposed in this paper. In this approach, the aerodynamics of airship is calculated based on a panel method, an engineering estimation and theory approach. A new numerical method for calculating added masses of airship is developed by using the CFD method. This model can simulate the motion of stratosphere airships quickly and accurately.},

abstract = {Abstract The low grade heat utilization is not only an inevitable option to solve the energy and environment problems, but also a critical issue for many remote power applications and planetary explorations. In this study, a novel design called a heat engine aerobot which can convert planetary atmospheric energy to electricity is proposed and analysed. A dynamic theoretical model is established and some key issues, such as the thermodynamic performance and conversion efficiency are analysed. It shows that the heat engine aerobot is capable to convert the low grade atmospheric energy to electricity during its self-sustained vertical oscillation movement. Parametric analysis shows that some design parameters, such as the nozzle number, the nozzle outlet diameter, the initial liquid mass and the turbine start height may have significant influence on the energy generation performance.},

Design/methodology/approach The trajectories are based upon Bezier curves whose control points positions are optimized through particle swarm optimization algorithm. A minimum energy strategy is implemented by considering the airship physical properties. The paper describes the mathematical model of the airships, the trajectories modelling through Bezier's curves and the optimization framework. A series of test cases has been developed to evaluate the proposed methodology. Findings Results obtained show that the implemented procedure is able to optimize the airship trajectories and to support their in-flight docking; a strong influence of the wind speed and course on the trajectories planning is highlighted. Research limitations/implications The wind speed considered in these simulations depends only on altitude, and gusts effect has been neglected. Practical...},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for multidisciplinary design optimization of offshore wind turbines at system level. The formulation and implementation that enable the integrated aerodynamic and structural design of the rotor and tower simultaneously are detailed. The objective function to be minimized is the levelized cost of energy. The model includes various design constraints: stresses, deflections, modal frequencies and fatigue limits along different stations of the blade and tower. The rotor design variables are: chord and twist distribution, blade length, rated rotational speed and structural thicknesses along the span. The tower design variables are: tower thickness and diameter distribution, as well as the tower height. For the other wind turbine components, a representative mass model is used to include their dynamic interactions in the system. To calculate the system costs, representative cost models of a wind turbine located in an offshore wind farm are used. To show the potential of the method and to verify its usefulness, the 5 MW NREL wind turbine is used as a case study. The result of the design optimization process shows 2.3{\%} decrease in the levelized cost of energy for a representative Dutch site, while satisfying all the design constraints.},

The results indicate that the curve number value (CN2) is the most important parameter of the model and that no more than 9 parameters (out of 26) are needed to have an adequate representation of the model variability. The convergence of the parameter ranking for total sensitivity effects is relatively fast, which is promising for factor fixing purposes. It is also shown that the Sobol' sensitivity analysis enhances the understanding of the model, by e.g. pointing out 3 significant pairwise interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn general, it can be concluded that the Sobol' sensitivity analysis can be successfully applied for factor fixing and factor prioritization with respect to the input parameters of a SWAT model, even with a limited number of model evaluations.

Hence, surrogate models are used as computationally cheap approximations of the expensive objective function in order to guide the search for improved solutions. Due to the computational expense of doing a single function evaluation, the goal is to find optimal solutions within very few expensive evaluations. The multimodality of the expensive black-box function requires an algorithm that is able to search locally as well as globally. MATSuMoTo is able to address these challenges. MATSuMoTo offers various choices for surrogate models and surrogate model mixtures, initial experimental design strategies, and sampling strategies.

abstract = {Shape optimization is widely used in practice. The typical problem is to find the optimal shape which minimizes/maximizes a certain cost functional and satisfies some given constraints. Usually shape optimization problems are solved numerically, by some iterative method which also requires some gradient information. There are two approaches to provide such information: the direct approach and the adjoint approach. In this thesis the different approaches, for getting gradient information of the functional, will be presented and then the focus is to compare them. It will be shown that the adjoint approach has a great advantage, but that there also exist examples, where the adjoint technique does not work in the sense we will introduce it. Starting with the explanation of shape optimization, the direct and adjoint approach will be introduced. Then an introduction in shape derivatives is given and some necessary examples for them are shown. On the basis of a two-dimensional magnetostatic field problem, where the mathematical model is derived using Maxwell's equations, and is the varia- tional formulation of a boundary value problem, the process of getting gra- dient information will be shown. Finally, numerical results illustrate the two approaches.},

abstract = {A thorough investigation of the performance of broadband direct irradiance predictions using 21 solar radiation models, along with carefully measured radiation data and ancillary meteorological data, is detailed here. A sensitivity study and a detailed error analysis show that precipitable water, and even more so, turbidity, are the two most critical inputs, whose accuracy conditions the resulting uncertainty in irradiance predictions. Large prediction uncertainties result from the use of time/space interpolated or extrapolated data of precipitable water and turbidity. So that the results of performance assessment studies like this one can be of any significance, it is necessary to rely on highly accurate precipitable water and turbidity data from collocated instruments with an appropriate sampling rate. An experimental assessment of the performance of all models has been conducted, using nearly 5000 data points from five different sites covering a large range of geographical and climatic conditions. Direct irradiance measured with first-class instruments at these sites are compared to model predictions where precipitable water and turbidity are determined from collocated sunphotometric measurements. This experimental assessment is found to be less stringent than the theoretical assessment (in Part 1 of this investigation), while confirming its main results. The same four high-performance models as in Part 1 are finally recommended: CPCR2, MLWT2, REST and Yang (in alphabetical order). Remarkably, they can predict direct irradiance under a variety of atmospheric conditions within the uncertainty of modern and well-maintained pyrheliometers, provided that good quality inputs of precipitable water and turbidity are used. The MLWT2 model produces the best results, with the lowest bias and variance for any irradiance value. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, the kriging process variance was set to be the objective function with a constant correlation parameter in the optimization problem of selecting the optimal basis functions in the original dynamic kriging method, which proved to be unsuccessful at finding the optimal basis functions. In this paper, a revised dynamic kriging method, including two branches which are different in the objective function of the optimization problem for trend function (named DK-XV1 and DK-XV2, respectively), is proposed to design the trend function using cross-validation.

abstract = {Two dimensional steady Newtonian flow past oblate and prolate spheroid particles confined in cylindrical tubes of different diameters has been numerically investigated. The flow and drag phenomena of confined spheroid particles are governed by the equations of continuity and conservation of momentum. These equations along with appropriate boundary conditions have been solved using commercial software based on computational fluid dynamics. Extensive new results were obtained on individual and total drag coefficients of spheroid particles, along with streamline contours, distributions of pressure coefficients, and vorticity magnitudes on the surface of spheroid particles as functions of the Reynolds number (Re), the aspect ratio (e), and the wall factor ($\lambda$) over the following range of conditions: 1 e Re e 200, 0.25 e e e 2.5, and 2 e $\lambda$ e 30. For all values of the aspect ratio, as values of the Reynolds numbers and/or the wall factor increase, the length of recirculation wake increases. For fixed values of the aspect ratio and the Reynolds number, the increase in the value of the wall factor decrease both individual and the total drag coefficients. On the whole, regardless of the value of the aspect ratio, the wall effect was found to gradually diminish with the increasing Reynolds number and/or the wall factor. Finally, on the basis of the present numerical results a simple correlation has been proposed for the total drag coefficient of confined spheroid particles which can be used in new applications},

abstract = {This paper investigates the feasibility and economical advantages that could be offered by a new facility for the production of solar energy. The basic concept is to exploit a high altitude aerostatic platform to support Photovoltaic (PV) modules to substantially increase their output by virtue of the significantly enhanced solar radiation at the operating altitude of the aerostat. The electric energy is then transmitted to the ground using the aerostat mooring cable. The technical feasibility of the concept is demonstrated by using standard equations and realistic values for the relevant engineering parameters that describe the technical properties of the materials and subsystems. There are, nevertheless, issues to be addressed to improve the performance; however, none of these issues is deemed to negate the technical feasibility of this concept. A preliminary cost model is illustrated and using unit cost data for the various materials and subsystems it is shown that it is possible to identify a specific size that minimizes the cost of energy produced. This cost could be considerably lower than what can be achieved by solar panels based on the ground in the UK. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

In particular, a standard visual representation of the solution process would be particularly useful as a communication medium among practitioners and those new to the field. This paper presents the extended design structure matrix (XDSM), a new diagram for visualizing MDO processes. The diagram is based on extending the standard design structure matrix (DSM) to simultaneously show data dependency and process flow on a single diagram. Modifications include adding special components to define iterative processes, defining different line styles to show data and process connections independently, and adding a numbering scheme to define the order in which the components are executed. This paper describes the rules for constructing XDSMs along with many examples, including diagrams of several MDO architectures. Finally, this paper discusses potential applications of the XDSM in other areas of MDO and the future development of the diagrams.},

Motivated by this fact, three-dimensional numerical simulations of heat and fluid flow past non-spherical particles at different angles of attack were performed. In particular, a laminar-steady flow past ellipsoidal and cubic particles was considered and the results compared against those for a spherical particle. In order to take into account the angle of attack in semi-empirical models, new correlations for the drag, lift and torque coefficients and for the Nusselt number were developed and the accuracy of the closures is discussed in comparison with published models.?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The basic theory of the method of orthogonal experiment is discussed, and the selection of factors and levels of the experiment and the choice of the evaluation function are also revealed. The proposed methodology is validated in the optimization design of the power system of the ZhiYuan-2 stratospheric airship.

It is followed by a description of a wide variety of unconventional airships with distinct features due to unique shape design, lifting gas, operation mode, or payload capability. The current ongoing airship projects in the world are summarized and the characteristics of hybrid airships and heavy-lift air vehicles are analyzed in greater detail because of the increasing interest in their development. The techniques of modeling, structural analysis, and simulation used during airship development are reviewed. Also, the optimization of airship body shape is briefly discussed. The main emphasis of this review is on the consideration of the structural aspects. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The momentum and heat transfer phenomena of spheroid particles in an unbounded Newtonian fluid have been numerically investigated by solving governing conservation equations of the mass, the momentum and the energy. The numerical solution methodology has been benchmarked by performing comparisons between present results with those reported in the literature. Further, extensive new results have been obtained to elucidate effects of pertinent dimensionless parameters such as the Reynolds number (Re), the Prandtl number (Pr) and the aspect ratio (e) on the flow and heat transfer behaviour of spheroid particles in the range of parameters: 1 ≤ Re ≤ 200; 1 ≤ Pr ≤ 1000 and 0.25 ≤ e ≤ 2.5. Regardless of the value of the Reynolds number, the total and individual drag coefficients of oblate spheroids (e {\textless} 1) are smaller than those of spheres (e = 1) and opposite trend has been observed for prolate spheroids (e {\textgreater} 1). Irrespective of values of Reynolds and Peclet numbers, the average Nusselt number is large for prolate particles as compared to spheres and opposite trend has been observed for the case of oblate particles. Major contribution of this work is the development of simple correlations for the total drag coefficient and the average Nusselt number of unconfined isolated spheroid particles based on present numerical results which can be used in new applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considers new evidence of climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty) The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary.

This shape was one of two bodies tested to determine the drag force measuring capabilities of the 13 inch MSBS. In addition, support interference on this shape at zero incidence was quantified by using a dummy sting. The drag force calibrations and wind-on repeatability data make it possible to assess the drag force measuring capabilities of the 13 inch MSBS. Comparisons with and without the sting showed differences in the drag coefficients with the dummy sting case resulting in lower drag coefficients.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in exploring the actual impact of adjustable parameters on response variables. Amongst the wide range of documented studies on sensitivity measures and analysis, Sobol' indices have received greater portion of attention due to the fact that they can provide accurate information for most models. In this paper, a novel analytical expression to compute the Sobol' indices is derived by introducing a method which uses the Gaussian Radial Basis Function to build metamodels of computationally expensive computer codes. Performance of the proposed method is validated against various analytical functions and also a structural simulation scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is an efficient approach, requiring a computational cost of one to two orders of magnitude less when compared to the traditional Quasi Monte Carlo-based evaluation of Sobol' indices.},

@article{Kleijnen1995,
abstract = {This paper discusses what-if analysis and optimization of system dynamics models. These problems are solved, using the statistical techniques of regression analysis and Design of Experiments (DOE). These issues are illustrated by applying the statistical techniques to a system dynamics model for coal transportation, taken from Wolstenholme's book System Enquiry: a System Dynamics Approach (1990). The regression analysis uses the least-squares algorithm. DOE uses classic designs, namely, factorials and central composite designs. Compared with intuitive approaches, DOE is more efficient: DOE gives more accurate estimators of input effects. Moreover DOE is more effective: interactions among inputs are estimable too. The system dynamics model is also optimized, using a heuristic that is inspired by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) but that also accounts for constraints. Conclusions are presented for the case study, and general principles are derived. References are given for further study.},

The investigations into reactive excitation power released by the excitation capacitor and SEC illustrate that the optimal excitation capacitor is not only related to generator parameters, speed range, and load, but also affected by wind turbine power curve. Based on the objective of minimizing the capacity of SEC, several methods are employed here to select an appropriate excitation capacitor.

On the basis of this, the simulation and experimental works from the prototype of 18-kW six/three-phase DWIG wind power system are carried out to verify the optimal scheme. The results demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of this optimization scheme.},
