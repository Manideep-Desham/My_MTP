@article{Kale2005a,
	abstract = {Aerostat envelopes are generally bodies of revolution with length to diameter ratio ranging from 3 to 5. Drag coefficient for this class of bodies can be obtained using empirical formulae or co-relations based on experimental studies. However such formulae are valid for specific class of envelope shapes only and result in errors of around 30{\%} compared to the values determined by numerical methods. The motivation for the present study arose from the need for a simple but generic methodology to estimate coefficient of drag as a function of envelope geometry, thus eliminating the need for running numerically expensive CFD codes each time the shape is altered during an optimisation exercise. In a previous study, the envelop shape was parameterized in terms of six geometric coefficients, and a shape generation algorithm was developed to generate various possible shapes satisfying manufacturing and few geometric design constraints. An empirical co-relation for envelope drag coefficient was developed, but it was not amenable to coupling with an MDO process, since it required detailed geometric data about the envelope shape, especially the coordinates of several points at the nose and trailing edge, and the grid density in these regions. In the present study, around 600 feasible shapes satisfying the user-specified volume and length constraints were generated using the shape generation algorithm. The flow patterns over these shapes were studied using FLUENT™ CFD Package and a better corelation was obtained by fitting a quadratic response surface using Design-Expert™ package. The current methodology uses only the values of six design variables to determine the drag coefficient, thus making it easy to integrate with a multi-disciplinary optimization algorithm for determining optimum envelope shape.

@article{Ceruti2013b,
	abstract = {This paper describes the Multi Disciplinary Optimization of an airship with unconventional configuration. The shape of the airship is based upon two semi-ellipsoids, whose axis ratios can be altered for optimization purpose. The parameters to optimize are: volume, ratio between longitudinal and lateral semi-axis, ratio between vertical and lateral semi-axis, percentage of the top surface covered by photovoltaic films, dimension of the tail. The goals of the optimization are: equilibrium between buoyancy and weight, reaching of the design speed, static longitudinal stability of the vehicle. The mathematical model developed to evaluate airship features includes the computation of the ballonet volume, a weight breakdown, the energy storage for night operations, the power system evaluation and stability considerations. Six heuristic optimization strategies have been applied in order to achieve the best solution; some case studies have been developed and the final optimal configurations found by algorithms have been analyzed in order to validate the optimization framework. The approach demonstrate that the heuristic optimization strategies used are good tool for the conceptual design of unconventional airship since this problem requires a multi-disciplinary approach and several parameters including aerodynamics, propulsion, mass breakdown, aerostatics and stability, which are strongly dependent each other, must be jointly considered and addressed at the same time to obtain an optimum and balanced design},
