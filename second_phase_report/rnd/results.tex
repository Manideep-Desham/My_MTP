\section{Multi-disciplinary shape optimisation}
Two disciplines namely aerodynamics and structures which involves the calculation of aerodynamic drag ($ C_{DV} $) and von-mises ($ \sigma _{v} $) stress are considered for shape optimisation of airship profile. The aim is to have lowest possible aerodynamic drag and Von-Mises stress. To acieve this, we develop a composite objective function minimising which, both $ C_{DV} $ and $ \sigma _{v} $ are minimised simultaneously.
The objective function is defined as
\begin{equation}
F_{comp} = \frac{1}{2}\bigg( \frac{C_{DV}}{C_{DV,ref}} + \dfrac{\sigma _{v}}{\sigma _{v,ref}} \bigg)
\end{equation}

Where, $C_{DV,ref} , \sigma _{v,ref}  $ are the values of these parameters corresponding to the reference shape.  The values obtained in Table \ref{sub-optimal solution obtained} and \ref{Optimal solution obtained for mimimum sigma_v} are taken as reference values for $C_{DV,ref}$ and $\sigma _{v,ref}  $ respectively. The composite objective function now becomes:
\begin{equation}
F_{comp} = 0.5*(0.0000* C_{DV} + 0.0000 * \sigma _{v})
\end{equation}
