In our case, 80 DOEs are generated and steady state 3D CFD analysis has been performed for these 80 shapes. The solver parameters used are as follows:

\section{Grid Convergence study}

Effect of grid size on the overall results by  changing the number of cells in self similar mesh has been carried out. Below is the plot of variation of pressure and viscous drag with number of cells for a simulation. As mentioned by \cite{Suman2011} , when the percentage change in the values is less than 5 \%, then the solution is reported to have grid convergence.

	\begin{tabular}{ccc}
		\hline \hline
		Cells & Pressure Drag (N) & Viscous Drag (N) \\
		\hline \hline

		604375  & 2.2  & 11.68 \\

Since there is no considerable amount of change in drag values, the number of cells are taken are around 1 million instead of 1.5 million for all the cases. This saves computational time.

\section{Results of CFD simulations}

	\caption{Variation of volumetric drag coefficient with design number}
	\label{Volumetric drag coefficient plot} %      only if needed
\end{figure}

From figure \ref{Volumetric drag coefficient plot} we can see that some shapes are having very high drag coefficient compared to others. To see one of these high and low drag bodies visually, they have been drawn in figure \ref{visual comparison} one on top of other with scale being the same. Given a fixed volume, bodies with non-axisymmetric shapes will have higher frontal area compared to axisymmetric body as shown in fig.\ref{visual comparison}. This makes the non-axisymmetric body more 'bluffy'. This leads to flow separation which is a non-linear phenomenon.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=300 pt]{rnd/visual_low_high.png}
	\caption{Visual comparison of low and high drag bodies}
	\label{visual comparison} %      only if needed
\end{figure}

The surface streamlines have been plotted in Figure \ref{low drag body} and \ref{high drag body} to understand the physics behind large difference in drag. It can be seen that long sleek body is having very less flow separation at the leading edge whereas the other body with more frontal area is have more flow separation and wake region.

	\includegraphics[width=300 pt]{rnd/streamlines_25_l.png}

\end{figure}

To couple a surrogate model with optimizer, the model needs to be accurate enough. The \% error should be less than 2\% as suggested by \cite{alam2017thesis}. But because of large variance in the training data, the model obtained is not accurate enough. This is because the bodies having more pressure drag because of flow separation are acting as outliers in the training data. So, the bodies having volumetric drag coefficient more than 0.04 are not considered while fitting the model. This gives a fairly better model with \% error $ \le $ 6\% in the case of Kriging.

 


\section{Testing the accuracy of surrogate model}

Three surrogate models mentioned in section \ref{Different surrogates used during this investigation} has been fit to the above data. Then eight random design points has been generated in the domain for testing purpose. The results are shown in the following table \ref{Accuracy of different surrogate models}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Accuracy of different surrogate models}
	\label{Accuracy of different surrogate models}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cccc}
		\hline \hline
		Random Exp.No	&Kriging (\% Error)	&PRS (\% Error)	&RBF (\% Error) \\
		\hline \hline
		1 &5.72 &3.24	&2.73 \\
		2 &4.82	&11.33	&36.40 \\
		3 &0.96	&6.09	&12.73 \\
		4 &1.15	&7.98	&18.62 \\
		5 &2.50	&5.40	&14.13 \\
		6 &1.29	&6.31	&1.75 \\
		7 &1.99	&0.59	&10.05 \\
		8 &5.64	&3.36	&1.12 \\
		\hline \hline
		Avg. \% Error	& 3.00875	& 5.5375	& 12.19 \\
		\hline \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


From the above results we can observe that Kriging predicted the functional behaviour with more accuracy. Radial basis function is having more error because the amount of training data to fit RBF is not sufficient in our case. Accuracy of polynomial response surface is between Kriging and Radial basis function. This is because PRS only sees at the global functional behaviour and underfits the model. So, Kriging has been selected for coupling with optimiser in our study.

Also, few machine learning algorithms have been applied to see if they predict better than Kriging. It can be seen from Table \ref{Accuracy of different machine learning models} that none of them is predicting the functional behaviour better than Kriging. The reason is obvious. Machine learning models are very generalised models and they can be used for both numerical and non-numerical experiments provided that large amount of training data is available. Since in our case the data is limited, we cannot use machine learning models. This further demonstrates the efficacy of Kriging for precting functional behaviour of numerical experiments.

\section{Optimal shape for minimal aerodynamic drag}

Table \ref{optimal solution obtained} shows the design parametres of the optimal shape with minimum aerodynamic drag. It can be observed that the $ scale_y $ parametre is 1 which means the optimal shape is axisymmetric. The results is obvious as given a fixed volume, axisymmetric bodies will have minimum frontal area which is responsible for pessure drag. The shape is shown in fig \ref{Optimal min cdv}
